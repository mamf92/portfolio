# 🧑‍💻 Martin Fischer – Front-End Developer Portfolio (Portfolio 1)

This is my first-year **Portfolio 1 Course Assignment** as part of the Front-End Development programme at Noroff. It’s a single-page portfolio site showcasing three of my graded projects from the first year:  

- 🎒 [Semester Project 1 – Community Science Museum](https://mamf92.github.io/semester-project-1/)
- 🧥 [Cross-Course Project – RainyDays v2](https://mamf92.github.io/rainydays-v2/)
- 💜 [Project Exam 1 – ESC News](https://mamf92.github.io/escnews/)

The purpose of this project is to self-assess, reflect on what I’ve learned so far, and demonstrate how my skills have developed throughout the year.

## 📋 Description

The goal was to build a clean, responsive, and accessible portfolio site using only **vanilla HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** (no frameworks). The site includes teaser cards for three major assignments with thumbnails, links to GitHub repositories, and deployed demos.

In addition to building the site, I wrote a reflection report discussing:
- Improvements I’ve made based on feedback
- What I would improve further
- What I’ve learned from each project

Feedback from teachers have been used to improve on the projects, but also inspired changes to the next versions of the pages.
